Suppose the user has accidentally typed an `m` after `var2`. Then  the label for `var1` is assigned to `my label 1 var2` with potentially a warning message about an uninitialized variable `m` (or thereabouts [*]). If the user has accidentally typed `3` instead of `m`, the label assigned to `var1` will be `'my label 1 var2 3 = my label 2'` (or thereabouts [*]).
`LABEL var1 = 'my label 1' `
`      var2 m = 'my label 2'`
`      var3 = 'my label 3';`

[*] I say 'thereabouts' as I'm not 100% sure when the language will insert whitespace between the non-quoted parts of the label. However, the rest of the described behavior is documented in [1]."
