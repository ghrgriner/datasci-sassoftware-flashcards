Note the disclaimer of warranties in the CC BY 4.0 license:

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,
and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This
includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not
known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in
full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You
on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or
otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential,
punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising
out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the
Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs,
expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in
full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
