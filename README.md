# Overview

This small repository contains the [text contents](ds_sassoftware_statprog_bios_comb.txt)
of a flashcard deck for reviewing statistical programming in both the R and SAS
programming languages / statistical environments. The R content is incomplete in the sense
that I have shared some notes on selected advanced topics only [in another deck](https://github.com/ghrgriner/advanced-R-flashcards) under a different license. This other deck is omitted
from further discussion here. The deck is also provided in Anki package format (.apkg file)
with each release.

The R notes cover both base R and 'tidyverse' programming [2], but the graphics
discussion is pretty limited. The notes on the SAS language cover base SAS,
macro programming, selected SAS/STAT procedures, and the output delivery system (ODS).
